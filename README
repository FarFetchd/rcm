Raspbian Control of MPD
=======================

A simple hacked together controller for mpc/mpd, meant for a Raspberry Pi.

Runs an HTTP server on port 10005. Point a web browser at
http://THE_RPI_IP_ADDRESS:10005/RCMLAZYSTARTmainRCixMlz1zlMxiCR

Compile with `g++ -std=c++17 -pthread -o rcm rcm.cc`, and then simply run the resulting
binary on the RPi. (Can run from any working directory).
